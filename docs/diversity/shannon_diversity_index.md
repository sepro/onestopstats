# Shannon Diversity Index (SDI)

The Shannon Diversity Index is a measure of species diversity in a community. It takes into account both the number of species present and their relative abundances. 

## Use Cases

The Shannon Diversity Index is commonly used in ecology to compare the diversity of different communities or to monitor changes in diversity over time. It can also be used to compare the diversity of different functional groups within a community or to compare diversity between different environmental gradients.

## Notes

It is important to note that the index does not account for the phylogenetic relatedness of species. It would be important to account for the phylogenetic relatedness of species in ecosystems where closely related species are expected to have similar ecological functions or traits. For example, in systems with a high degree of niche specialization, such as coral reefs or tropical rainforests, communities may be composed of closely related species that have evolved to occupy specific niches and perform specialized functions. In these cases, the phylogenetic relationships between species can provide important information about their functional similarities and differences. Similarly, in systems where competition is an important driver of community structure, such as grasslands or savannas, closely related species may compete more strongly with one another than distantly related ones. In these cases, accounting for the phylogenetic relationships between species can help to identify patterns of coexistence and competitive exclusion.
