# Dominance

Dominance is a metric used to study diversity in a community. It refers to the measure of how common or abundant a particular species is compared to others in the same ecosystem. A community with high dominance has a few species that are very abundant, while a community with low dominance has many species with similar abundances.

## Use Cases

This metric is particularly useful in conservation biology, where it can be used to assess the health of ecosystems and to identify areas that may be at risk due to changes in the environment or human activities. For example, if a community has a high dominance index, it may be more vulnerable to disturbances that affect the dominant species.
