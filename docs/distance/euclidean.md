# Euclidian distance
Euclidean distance is a mathematical measure of the distance between two points in a *n*-dimensional space. It is commonly used in many fields, including mathematics, physics, and computer science.

The Euclidean distance formula for two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in a 2D space can be expressed as:

```d = sqrt((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2)```
