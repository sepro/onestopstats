# Bray Curtis Dissimilarity

The Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity is a measure of dissimilarity between two sets of observations. It is commonly used in ecology to compare the composition of species in different locations. The Bray-Curtis distance is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between the abundances of each species in the two sets, divided by the total abundance of all species. It ranges from 0 (when the two sets are identical) to 1 (when the two sets have no species in common).

## Use Cases

The Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity is commonly used in microbiology to compare the microbial communities in different samples, such as the gut microbiome of healthy individuals vs those with a disease, soil samples, water samples, food products, and different parts of the human body. It helps to identify differences in microbial composition and potential causes of diseases, understand how environmental factors affect microbial community structure, identify spoilage microorganisms, ensure food safety, and investigate how microbial communities vary across different body sites.

## Assumptions

The Bray-Curtis distance assumes that the data being compared are **relative abundances or proportions, rather than absolute counts**. This means that the distance is calculated based on the proportional differences between the different species or taxa in the samples, rather than on the absolute number of individuals. 

## Conclusion

The Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity is a measure of dissimilarity between two sets of observations, commonly used in ecology to compare the composition of species in different locations. It is an important tool for microbiologists and ecologists, as it can be used to identify differences in bacterial communities, understand how environmental factors affect the composition of microbial communities, and ensure food safety. It is important to note that the Bray-Curtis distance assumes that the data being compared are proportional abundances or proportions, rather than absolute counts.
