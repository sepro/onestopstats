# Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test

The Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test is a statistical test that is used to compare two groups of data to see if they are different from each other. It is a non-parametric test, which means that it does not assume that the data is normally distributed. 

## Use Cases

The Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test can be used to compare the effectiveness of two different antibiotics in treating a bacterial infection. Researchers can collect data on the number of bacteria present in a sample before and after treatment with each antibiotic. They can then use the Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test to determine if there is a significant difference in the reduction of bacteria between the two antibiotics.

  
## Assumptions

  * **Independence**: The observations in each group must be independent of each other. This means that the value of one observation should not be influenced by the value of another observation.

  * **Random Sampling**: The observations in each group must be randomly sampled from their respective populations.

  * **Homogeneity of Variance**: The variance of the data in each group should be roughly equal. This assumption is less important than the independence assumption, and violations of this assumption can often be tolerated.

  * **Ordinal Data**: The Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test assumes that the data is at least ordinal, meaning that it can be ranked from lowest to highest.

## Conclusion

The Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test is a powerful non-parametric test that can be used to compare two groups of data. It is important to remember that the test has certain assumptions that must be met in order for the results to be valid. If these assumptions are not met, then the results of the test may not be reliable.
