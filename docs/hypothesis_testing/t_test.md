# Student's t-test

A t-test is a statistical test used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups. 

## Use Cases

  * A researcher wants to know if there is a significant difference in the average height of male and female students in a school. They can use a t-test to compare the mean height of the male students to the mean height of the female students.

  * A company wants to know if there is a significant difference in the average sales of two different products. They can use a t-test to compare the mean sales of Product A to the mean sales of Product B.
  
## Assumptions

A t-test makes the following assumptions about the data:

  * **Normality:** The data should be normally distributed. This means that the data should follow a bell-shaped curve.

  * **Independence:** The observations in each group should be independent of each other. This means that the value of one observation should not be influenced by the value of another observation.

  * **Equal variance:** The variance of the data in each group should be equal. This means that the spread of the data in each group should be similar.

If these assumptions are not met, the results of the t-test may not be reliable.

## Conclusion

The t-test is a simple statistical test that is commonly used to compare the means of two groups. While it makes certain assumptions about the data, it is still a useful tool in many studies. It is easy to perform and interpret, and can provide valuable insights into the differences between two groups. However, it is important to ensure that the assumptions of the test are met before using it, and to consider other tests if the data does not meet these assumptions.
