It is a method of dimensionality reduction that takes a distance matrix as input and produces a set of new variables, called principal coordinates, that capture the maximum amount of variation in the data.  PCoA tries to preserve the distances between samples in higher dimensions when reducing the dimensionality of the data. It does this by projecting the data onto a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much of the original distance information as possible.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"distance/bray_curtis":{"id":"distance/bray_curtis","title":"Bray Curtis Dissimilarity","description":"The Bray-Curtis Dissimilarity is a measure of dissimilarity between two sets of observations. It is commonly used in ecology to compare the composition of species in different locations. The Bray-Curtis distance is calculated as the sum of the absolute differences between the abundances of each species in the two sets, divided by the total abundance of all species. It ranges from 0 (when the two sets are identical) to 1 (when the two sets have no species in common).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"distance/euclidean":{"id":"distance/euclidean","title":"Euclidian distance","description":"Euclidean distance is a mathematical measure of the distance between two points in a n-dimensional space. It is commonly used in many fields, including mathematics, physics, and computer science.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"distance/unifrac":{"id":"distance/unifrac","title":"UNIFRAC","description":"The UNIFRAC distance is a mathematical measure that is used to compare the diversity of microbial communities. It is a way of comparing the similarity or dissimilarity of different microbial communities based on the presence or absence of specific microbial taxa (species or groups of species), taking their taxonomy into account.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"diversity/dominance":{"id":"diversity/dominance","title":"Dominance","description":"Dominance is a metric used to study diversity in a community. It refers to the measure of how common or abundant a particular species is compared to others in the same ecosystem. A community with high dominance has a few species that are very abundant, while a community with low dominance has many species with similar abundances.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"diversity/evenness":{"id":"diversity/evenness","title":"Evenness","description":"Evenness is a term used in ecology to describe the degree of similarity or differences in abundance among different species in a community. It is a measure of how evenly distributed individuals are across different species within a community.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"diversity/shannon_diversity_index":{"id":"diversity/shannon_diversity_index","title":"Shannon Diversity Index (SDI)","description":"The Shannon Diversity Index is a measure of species diversity in a community. It takes into account both the number of species present and their relative abundances.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"hypothesis_testing/beta_disper":{"id":"hypothesis_testing/beta_disper","title":"Beta Dispersion Test","description":"The beta dispersion test is a statistical hypothesis test used to assess whether the variance within different groups in a dataset is equal or not. It is commonly used in ecology to test whether the dispersion of species composition among sites is the same. The test is based on the beta distribution, which is a probability distribution used for modeling proportions and rates.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"hypothesis_testing/multiple_hypothesis_correction/fdr":{"id":"hypothesis_testing/multiple_hypothesis_correction/fdr","title":"False Discovery Rate (FDR)","description":"False Discovery Rate (FDR) is a statistical method that is used to control the number of false positives when testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously. In simple terms, it helps to control the rate at which we falsely identify something as significant when it is actually not.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"hypothesis_testing/t_test":{"id":"hypothesis_testing/t_test","title":"Student\'s t-test","description":"A t-test is a statistical test used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"hypothesis_testing/wilcoxon_ranksum":{"id":"hypothesis_testing/wilcoxon_ranksum","title":"Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test","description":"The Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test is a statistical test that is used to compare two groups of data to see if they are different from each other. It is a non-parametric test, which means that it does not assume that the data is normally distributed.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"intro":{"id":"intro","title":"Intro","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"neural_networks/autoencoder":{"id":"neural_networks/autoencoder","title":"Autoencoder","description":"An autoencoder is a type of neural network that is trained to compress and decompress data. It consists of an encoder that compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation, and a decoder that reconstructs the original data from the compressed representation. The goal of an autoencoder is to learn a compressed representation that captures the most important features of the input data, while minimizing the reconstruction error.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
