It is a method of dimensionality reduction that takes a distance matrix as input and produces a set of new variables, called principal coordinates, that capture the maximum amount of variation in the data.  PCoA tries to preserve the distances between samples in higher dimensions when reducing the dimensionality of the data. It does this by projecting the data onto a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much of the original distance information as possible.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"hypothesis_testing/multiple_hypothesis_correction/fdr":{"id":"hypothesis_testing/multiple_hypothesis_correction/fdr","title":"False Discovery Rate (FDR)","description":"False Discovery Rate (FDR) is a statistical method that is used to control the number of false positives when testing multiple hypotheses simultaneously.

It consists of an encoder that compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional representation, and a decoder that reconstructs the original data from the compressed representation. The goal of an autoencoder is to learn a compressed representation that captures the most important features of the input data, while minimizing the reconstruction error.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
